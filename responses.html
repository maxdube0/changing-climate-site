              <h2>Clean energy</h2>
              <p>Long-term decarbonisation scenarios point to rapid and significant investment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy" title="Renewable energy">renewable energy</a>, which includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">wind power</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass" title="Biomass">bioenergy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_energy" title="Geothermal energy">geothermal energy</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower" title="Sustainable energy">hydropower</a>. Fossil fuels accounted for 80% of the world's energy in 2018, while the remaining share was split between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a> and renewables; that mix is projected to change significantly over the next 30 years. Solar and wind have seen substantial growth and progress over the last few years; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_system" title="Photovoltaic system">photovoltaic solar</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power" title="Wind power">onshore wind</a> are the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in most countries. Renewables represented 75% of all new electricity generation installed in 2019, with solar and wind constituting nearly all of that amount. Meanwhile, nuclear power costs are increasing amidst stagnant power share, so that nuclear power generation is now several times more expensive per megawatt-hour than wind and solar.
              </p>
              <p>To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation, rising to 85% or more by 2050 in some scenarios.  The use of electricity for other needs, such as heating, would rise to the point where electricity becomes the largest form of overall energy supply. Investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by 2050.
              </p>
              <p>Clean energy improves human health by minimizing climate change and has the near-term benefit of reducing air pollution deaths, which were estimated at 7 million annually in 2016. Meeting the Paris Agreement goals that limit warming to a 2&nbsp;°C increase could save about a million of those lives per year by 2050, whereas limiting global warming to 1.5&nbsp;°C could save millions and simultaneously increase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_security" title="Energy security">energy security</a> and reduce poverty.

              <h2>Energy efficiency</h2>
              <p>Reducing energy demand is another major feature of decarbonisation scenarios and plans. In addition to directly reducing emissions, energy demand reduction measures provide more flexibility for low carbon energy development, aid in the management of the electricity grid, and minimise carbon-intensive infrastructure development. Over the next few decades, major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve these reductions, comparable to the expected level of investment in renewable energy. However, several COVID-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain.
              </p>
              <p>Efficiency strategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector. In transport, gains can be made by switching passengers and freight to more efficient travel modes, such as buses and trains, and increasing the use of electric vehicles. Industrial strategies to reduce energy demand include increasing the energy efficiency of heating systems and motors, designing less energy-intensive products, and increasing product lifetimes. In the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings, and incorporating higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting techniques for existing structures. Buildings would see additional electrification with the use of technologies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump" title="Heat pump">heat pumps</a>, which have higher efficiency than fossil fuels.

              <h2>Agriculture, industry, and transport</h2>
              <p>Agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand. A suite of actions could reduce agriculture/forestry-based greenhouse gas emissions by 66% from 2010 levels by reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production.
              </p>
              <p>In addition to the industrial demand reduction measures mentioned earlier, steel and cement production, which together are responsible for about 13% of industrial <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> emissions, present particular challenges. In these industries, carbon-intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production process. Reducing <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> emissions here requires research driven efforts aimed at decarbonizing the chemistry of these processes. In transport, scenarios envision sharp increases in the market share of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle" title="Electric vehicle">electric vehicles</a>, and low carbon fuel substitution for other transportation modes like shipping.

              <h2>Carbon sequestration</h2>
              <p>Natural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> beyond naturally occurring levels. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforestation" title="">Reforestation</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afforestation" title="Green industrial policy">tree planting on non-forest lands</a> are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although they raise food security concerns. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_agriculture" title="Regenerative agriculture">Soil carbon sequestration</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_carbon" title="">coastal carbon sequestration</a> are less understood options. The feasibility of land-based negative emissions methods for mitigation are uncertain in models; the IPCC has described mitigation strategies based on them as risky.
              </p>
              <p>Where energy production or <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span>-intensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_industry" title="Carbon sequestration">heavy industries</a> continue to produce waste <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span>, the gas can be captured and stored instead of being released to the atmosphere. Although its current use is limited in scale and expensive, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" title="Carbon capture and storage">carbon capture and storage</a> (CCS) may be able to play a significant role in limiting <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> emissions by mid-century.  This technique, in combination with bio-energy production (BECCS) can result in net-negative emissions, where the amount of greenhouse gasses that are released into the atmosphere are less than the sequestered, or stored, amount in the bio-energy fuel being grown. It remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques, such as BECCS, will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to 1.5&nbsp;°C, and policy decisions based on reliance on carbon dioxide removal increases the risk of global warming increasing beyond international goals.

              </p>
              <p>Adaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding at-risk areas, learning to live with increased flooding, protection and, if needed, the more transformative option of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_retreat" title="Managed retreat">managed retreat</a>. There are economic barriers for moderation of dangerous heat impact: avoiding strenuous work or employing private <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning" title="">air conditioning</a> is not possible for everybody. In agriculture, adaptation options include a switch to more sustainable diets, diversification, erosion control and genetic improvements for increased tolerance to a changing climate. Insurance allows for risk-sharing, but is often difficult to obtain for people on lower incomes. Education, migration and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_warning_system" title="Early warning system">early warning systems</a> can reduce climate vulnerability.
              </p>
              <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_and_ecosystems" title="Climate change and ecosystems">Ecosystems adapt to climate change</a>, a process that can be supported by human intervention. Possible responses include increasing connectivity between ecosystems, allowing species to migrate to more favourable climate conditions and species relocation. Protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural areas helps build resilience, making it easier for ecosystems to adapt. Many of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems, also help humans adapt via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem-based_adaptation" title="">ecosystem-based adaptation</a>. For instance, restoration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_regime" title="Fire regime">natural fire regimes</a> makes catastrophic fires less likely, and reduces human exposure. Giving rivers more space allows for more water storage in the natural system, reducing flood risk. Restored forest act as a carbon sink, but planting trees in unsuitable regions can exacerbate climate impacts.
