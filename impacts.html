Continued emission of greenhouse gases will lead to further warming and long-lasting changes in the climate system, with potentially “severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts” for both people and ecosystems. Climate change risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries.

              <h2>The physical environment</h2>
              <p>The environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather. Changes may occur gradually or rapidly. Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations. Since the 1950s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought" title="Drought">droughts</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave" title="Heat wave">heat waves</a> have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency. Extremely wet or dry events within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon" title="Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation">monsoon</a> period have increased in India and East Asia. The maximum rainfall and wind speed from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclones_and_climate_change" title="">hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing</a>.
              </p>
              <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise" title="">Global sea level is rising</a> as a consequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850" title="">glacial melt</a>, melt of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheet" title="Ice sheet">ice sheets</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland_ice_sheet" title="Developing countries">Greenland</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_ice_sheet" title="Antarctic ice sheet">Antarctica</a>, and thermal expansion. Between 1993 and 2017, the rise increased over time, averaging 3.1&nbsp;±&nbsp;0.3&nbsp;mm per year. Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects that in a very high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by 61–110&nbsp;cm. Increased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug Antarctic glacier outlets, risking a large melt of the ice sheet and the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions.
              </p>
              <p>Climate change has led to decades of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_sea_ice_decline" title="">shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice</a>, making it vulnerable to atmospheric anomalies. While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5&nbsp;°C (2.7&nbsp;°F) degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2.0&nbsp;°C (3.6&nbsp;°F). Higher atmospheric <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> concentrations have led to changes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_chemistry" title="Ocean chemistry">ocean chemistry</a>. An increase in dissolved <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> is causing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification" title="Ocean acidification">oceans to acidify</a>. In addition, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_deoxygenation" title="">oxygen levels are decreasing</a> as oxygen is less soluble in warmer water, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_zone_(ecology)" title="Tropical cyclones and climate change">hypoxic dead zones</a> expanding as a result of algal blooms stimulated by higher temperatures, higher <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> levels, ocean deoxygenation, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication" title="Eutrophication">eutrophication</a>.

              <h2>Nature and Wildlife</h2>
              <p>Recent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitudes" class="mw-redirect" title="Altitudes">altitudes</a>. Higher atmospheric <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening, whereas heatwaves and drought have reduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem" title="Heat wave">ecosystem</a> productivity in some regions. The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear. Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification" title="Desertification">expansion of deserts</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics" title="">subtropics</a>. The size and speed of global warming is making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_threshold" title="Ecological threshold">abrupt changes in ecosystems</a> more likely. Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction" title="Extinction">extinction</a> of many species.
              </p>
              <p>The oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land. Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, with harmful effects found on a wide range of organisms such as corals, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelp" title="Kelp">kelp</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seabirds" class="mw-redirect" title="Seabirds">seabirds</a>. Ocean acidification is impacting organisms who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomineralization" title="Biomineralization">produce shells and skeletons</a>, such as mussels and barnacles, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef" title="Coral reef">coral reefs</a>; coral reefs have seen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_bleaching" title="Coral bleaching">extensive bleaching</a> after heat waves. Harmful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algal_bloom" title="Algal bloom">algae bloom</a> enhanced by climate change and eutrophication cause anoxia, disruption of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_web" title="Food web">food webs</a> and massive large-scale mortality of marine life. Coastal ecosystems are under particular stress, with almost half of wetlands having disappeared as a consequence of climate change and other human impacts.
