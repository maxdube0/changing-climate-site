            <p>Health impacts include both the direct effects of extreme weather, leading to injury and loss of life, as well as indirect effects, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undernutrition" class="mw-redirect" title="Undernutrition">undernutrition</a> brought on by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_failure" class="mw-redirect" title="Crop failure">crop failures</a>. Various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infectious_diseases" class="mw-redirect" title="Infectious diseases">infectious diseases</a> are more easily transmitted in a warmer climate, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever" title="Dengue fever">dengue fever</a>, which affects children most severely, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria" title="">malaria</a>. Young children are the most vulnerable to food shortages, and together with older people, to extreme heat. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from heat exposure in elderly people, increases in diarrheal disease, malaria, dengue, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.orghttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_flooding" title="Effects of climate change on humans">coastal flooding</a>, and childhood undernutrition.  Over 500,000 additional adult deaths are projected yearly by 2050 due to reductions in food availability and quality. Other major health risks associated with climate change include air and water quality. The WHO has classified human impacts from climate change as the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.

            <p>Climate change is affecting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security" title="Food security">food security</a> and has caused reduction in global mean yields of maize, wheat, and soybeans between 1981 and 2010. Future warming could further reduce global yields of major crops. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_productivity" class="mw-redirect" title="Crop productivity">Crop production</a> will probably be negatively affected in low-latitude countries, while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative. Up to an additional 183 million people worldwide, particularly those with lower incomes, are at risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunger" title="Hunger">hunger</a> as a consequence of these impacts. The effects of warming on the oceans impact fish stocks, with a global decline in the maximum catch potential. Only polar stocks are showing an increased potential. Regions dependent on glacier water, regions that are already dry, and small islands are at increased risk of water stress due to climate change.
