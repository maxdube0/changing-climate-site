            <p>Economic damages due to climate change have been underestimated, and may be severe, with the probability of disastrous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory" title="Regional effects of climate change">tail-risk events</a> being nontrivial. Climate change has likely already increased global economic inequality, and is projected to continue doing so. Most of the severe impacts are expected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Africa" title="Climate change in Africa">in sub-Saharan Africa</a> and South-East Asia, where existing poverty is already exacerbated. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a> estimates that climate change could drive over 120 million people into poverty by 2030. Current inequalities between men and women, between rich and poor, and between different ethnicities have been observed to worsen as a consequence of climate variability and climate change. An expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_conflict" class="mw-redirect" title="Armed conflict">armed conflict</a> has been small compared to factors such as socio-economic inequality and state capabilities, but that future warming will bring increasing risks.

            <p>Low-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened through hazards posed by sea level rise, such as flooding and permanent submergence. This could lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statelessness" title="Statelessness">statelessness</a> for populations in island nations, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldives" title="Maldives">Maldives</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuvalu" title="Tuvalu">Tuvalu</a>. In some regions, rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to. With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in extremely hot and uninhabitable climates, similar to the current climate found mainly in the Sahara. These factors, plus weather extremes, can drive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_migrant" title="Environmental migrant">environmental migration</a>, both within and between countries. Displacement of people is expected to increase as a consequence of more frequent extreme weather, sea level rise, and conflict arising from increased competition over natural resources. Climate change may also increase vulnerabilities, leading to "trapped populations" in some areas who are not able to move due to a lack of resources.
