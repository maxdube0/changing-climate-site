          <h2>Greenhouse Gasses</h2>
          <p>The Earth absorbs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a>, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_cooling" title="Radiative cooling">radiates it as heat</a>. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and reemit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared" title="Infrared">infrared</a> radiation, slowing the rate at which it can pass through the atmosphere and escape into space. Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33&nbsp;°C (59&nbsp;°F) warmer than it would have been in their absence. While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapour" class="mw-redirect" title="Water vapour">water vapour</a> (~50%) and clouds (~25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback" title="Feedback">feedbacks</a>. On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> (~20%), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropospheric_ozone" title="Tropospheric ozone">tropospheric ozone</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon" title="Chlorofluorocarbon">CFCs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide" title="Nitrous oxide">nitrous oxide</a> are not temperature-dependent, and are therefor considered external forcings.
          </p>
          <p>Human activity since the Industrial Revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal" title="Coal">coal</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">oil</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas" title="">natural gas</a>), has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing" title="Radiative forcing">radiative imbalance</a>. In 2018, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas#Anthropogenic_greenhouse_gases" title="Greenhouse gas">concentrations</a> of <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> and methane had increased by about 45% and 160%, respectively, since 1750. These <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> levels are much higher than they have been at any time during the last 800,000 years, the period for which reliable data have been collected from air trapped in ice cores. Less direct geological evidence indicates that <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> values have not been this high for millions of years.
          </p>
          <p>Global anthropogenic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions" title="Coal seam gas">greenhouse gas emissions</a> in 2018, excluding those from land use change, were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_potential" title="Sunlight">equivalent to</a> 52&nbsp;billion tonnes of <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span>. Of these emissions, 72% was actual <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span>, 19% was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane" title="Methane">methane</a>, 6% was nitrous oxide, and 3% was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorinated_gases" title="Fluorinated gases">fluorinated gases</a>. <span class="nowrap"><span class="chemf nowrap">CO<span style="display:inline-block; margin-bottom:-0.3em; vertical-align:-0.4em; line-height:1.2em; font-size:70%; text-align:left;"><br>2</span></span></span> emissions primarily come from burning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel" title="">fossil fuels</a> to provide energy for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport" title="Transport">transport</a>, manufacturing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating#Energy_sources" class="mw-redirect" title="Heating">heating</a>, and electricity.

Methane emissions <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_fermentation" title="Enteric fermentation">come from livestock</a>, manure, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice#Environmental_impacts" title="Rice">rice cultivation</a>, landfills, wastewater, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_seam_gas" class="mw-redirect" title="">coal mining</a>, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_gas_emissions" title="Fugitive gas emissions">oil and gas extraction</a>. Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of inorganic and organic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer" title="Carbon sink">fertiliser</a>. From a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions_accounting#Measuring_GHG_emissions" class="mw-redirect" title="Fossil fuel">production standpoint</a>, the primary sources of global greenhouse gas emissions are estimated as: electricity and heat (25%), agriculture and forestry (24%), industry and manufacturing (21%), transport (14%), and buildings (6%).

            <h2>Aerosols and Clouds</h2>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution" title="Air pollution">Air pollution</a>, in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol" title="">aerosols</a>, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates#Climate_effects" title="Thermohaline circulation">affects the climate</a> on a large scale. From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiance" title="Irradiance">sunlight reaching the Earth's surface</a> was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_dimming" title="Global dimming">global dimming</a></i>, typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_deposition" class="mw-redirect" title="Fluorinated gases">Aerosol removal by precipitation</a> gives tropospheric aerosols an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_lifetime" class="mw-redirect" title="Atmospheric lifetime">atmospheric lifetime</a> of only about a week, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere" title="Greenhouse gas emissions">stratospheric</a> aerosols can remain in the atmosphere for a few years. Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to their direct effects (scattering and absorbing solar radiation), aerosols have indirect effects on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget" title="Industrial processes">Earth's radiation budget</a>. Sulfate aerosols act as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_condensation_nuclei" title="Cloud condensation nuclei">cloud condensation nuclei</a> and thus lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets. These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets. This effect also causes droplets to be more uniform in size, which reduces the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_physics#Collision-coalescence" title="Cloud physics">growth of raindrops</a> and makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight. Indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.
            </p>
            <p>While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_carbon" title="Shifting cultivation">black carbon</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soot" title="Soot">soot</a> that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming. Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise. Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by 0.2&nbsp;°C (0.36&nbsp;°F) by 2050.

            <h2>Changes of the land surface</h2>
            <p>Humans change the Earth's surface mainly to create more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_land" title="Atmospheric lifetime">agricultural land</a>. Today, agriculture takes up 34% of Earth's land area, while 26% is forests, and 30% is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc.). The amount of forested land continues to decrease, largely due to conversion to cropland in the tropics. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation" title="Deforestation">deforestation</a> is the most significant aspect of land surface change affecting global warming. The main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil (27%), logging to produce forestry/forest products (26%), short term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_cultivation" title="">shifting cultivation</a> (24%), and wildfires (23%).
            </p>
            <p>In addition to affecting greenhouse gas concentrations, land-use changes affect global warming through a variety of other chemical and physical mechanisms. Changing the type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature, by changing how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo" title="">albedo</a>), and how much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooling" class="mw-redirect" title="">heat is lost by evaporation</a>. For instance, the change from a dark <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest" title="Forest">forest</a> to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also contribute to changing temperatures by affecting the release of aerosols and other chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns. In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to an overall cooling effect. Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.
            </p>

        <div class="gridTxt">
            <h2>Solar and volcanic activity</h2>
            <p>Physical climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity. As the Sun is the Earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_variation" class="mw-redirect" title="Solar activity and climate">Solar irradiance</a> has been measured directly by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite" title="Satellite">satellites</a>, and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s. There has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth. Further evidence for greenhouse gases being the cause of recent climate change come from measurements showing the warming of the lower atmosphere (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere" title="Stratosphere">troposphere</a>), coupled with the cooling of the upper atmosphere (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere" title="">stratosphere</a>). If solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, warming of both the troposphere and the stratosphere would be expected, but that has not been the case.
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions#Plinian" title="">Explosive volcanic eruptions</a> represent the largest natural forcing over the industrial era. When the eruption is sufficiently strong (with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide" title="">sulfur dioxide</a> reaching the stratosphere) sunlight can be partially blocked for a couple of years, with a temperature signal lasting about twice as long. In the industrial era, volcanic activity has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends. Present-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_gas" title="Volcanic gas">volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a> are equivalent to less than 1% of current anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
